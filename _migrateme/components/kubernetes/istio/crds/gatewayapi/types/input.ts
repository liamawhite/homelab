         * GRPCRoute provides a way to route gRPC requests. This includes the capability
         * to match requests by hostname, gRPC service, gRPC method, or HTTP/2 header.
         * Filters can be used to specify additional processing steps. Backends specify
         * where matching requests will be routed.
         *
         * GRPCRoute falls under extended support within the Gateway API. Within the
         * following specification, the word "MUST" indicates that an implementation
         * supporting GRPCRoute must conform to the indicated requirement, but an
         * implementation not supporting this route type need not follow the requirement
         * unless explicitly indicated.
         *
         * Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` MUST
         * accept HTTP/2 connections without an initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. via
         * ALPN. If the implementation does not support this, then it MUST set the
         * "Accepted" condition to "False" for the affected listener with a reason of
         * "UnsupportedProtocol".  Implementations MAY also accept HTTP/2 connections
         * with an upgrade from HTTP/1.
         *
         * Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` MUST
         * support HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP (h2c,
         * https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.1) without an initial
         * upgrade from HTTP/1.1, i.e. with prior knowledge
         * (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540#section-3.4). If the implementation
         * does not support this, then it MUST set the "Accepted" condition to "False"

             * MUST be at least one intersecting hostname for the GRPCRoute to be

             *   hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.
             *
             * Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
             * as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
             * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

             * GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be
             * ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the
             * GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
             * `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered for a match.
             *
             * If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified hostnames, and none
             * match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute MUST NOT be accepted by

             *
             * If a Route (A) of type HTTPRoute or GRPCRoute is attached to a
             * Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of the other
             * type attached and the intersection of the hostnames of A and B is

             * ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
             * to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
             * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
             * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,

             * ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants

             * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
             * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
             *
             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
             * Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
             * generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

             *
             * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)

             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their
             * targeted conformance profile:
             *
             * HTTP Profile
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLS Profile

             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered

             *

             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
             *

             * match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The

             * `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
             *
             * In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify intersecting hostnames (e.g.

             * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
             * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
             *
             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,

             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support

             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific

             * logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
             * At least one Listener MUST be specified.
             *
             * Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
             * MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to

             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
             * Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their
             * targeted conformance profile:
             *
             * HTTP Profile
             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
             *
             * TLS Profile

             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             * from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
             * apply in that case).
             *
             * Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
             * combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
             *
             * Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered

             *
             * 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
             * 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided

             *
             * "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
             *
             * The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
             * Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
             * example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
             * can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
             * Listener fields.
             *
             * For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:
             *
             * 1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the "HTTP"
             *    Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the "HTTPS" or
             *    "TLS" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.
             * 3. A mixture of "TCP" and "UDP" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener
             *    with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
             *
             * Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect
             * whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant
             * for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
             *
             * When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol
             * Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the
             * Listener to be distinct.
             *
             * When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request
             * hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
             * values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
             *
             * Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
             * matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
             * matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
             * `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
             *
             * Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
             * wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
             * For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
             * The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
             * hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
             *
             * The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
             * the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
             * `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
             *
             * If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
             * Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
             * condition in the Listener Status to "True".
             *
             * Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
             * Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
             * no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may
             * accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting
             * Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.
             * This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting
             * Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at
             * least one Listener must be present.
             *
             * The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
             * Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
             * not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
             * indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
             * Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
             * indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
             *
             * A Gateway's Listeners are considered "compatible" if:
             *
             * 1. They are distinct.
             * 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
             *    requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
             *    addresses.
             *
             * Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
             * implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
             * may not be compatible for another.
             *
             * For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
             * on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
             * would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
             *
             * Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if
             * Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
             * request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
             * to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
             * This concept is known as "Listener Isolation". Implementations that do
             * not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
             *
             * Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
             * Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

             * as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
             * both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.
             *

             * `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match.

             * match with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The

             * `False` in the corresponding RouteParentStatus.
             *

             * to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
             * allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
             * not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *
             * * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)
             *
             * This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
             * rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
             * allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,

             * the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
             * namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
             * namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
             * and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is

             * create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
             * Route.
             *
             * There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:
             *

             * * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

             * resources.
             *
             * ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:
             *
             * * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
             *   entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
             *   multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
             *   be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
             * * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
             *   each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
             *   optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
             *   combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
             *
             * Some examples:
             *
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
             *   same object must also set `sectionName`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
             *   object must also set `port`.
             * * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
             *   referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.
             *
             * It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
             * be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
             * choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
             * case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
             * merged.
             *
             * Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
